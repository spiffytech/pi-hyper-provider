# @charmland/pi-hyper-provider

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@charmland/pi-hyper-provider.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@charmland/pi-hyper-provider)

A [Pi] extension that registers Charm's [Hyper] inference provider with Pi,
supporting API keys or OAuth, dynamic model discovery, and optionally showing
your team name and Hypercredit balance in the status line.

[Pi]: https://pi.dev
[Hyper]: https://hyper.charm.land

```sh
# via NPM
pi install npm:@charmland/pi-hyper-provider

# via git
pi install git:github.com/charmbracelet/pi-hyper-provider
```

## Usage

- To authenticate with OAuth, open `pi`, send `/login`, pick `Subscription`, and select the
  `Charm Hyper` provider.
- To authenticate with an API key, set the `HYPER_API_KEY` environment variable
  then open `pi`.

Pick a Hyper model by sending `/model` and filtering by either provider name
`hyper` or `model-name` like `glm-5.1`.

Model info is fetched at startup and cached locally; the cache is used as a
fallback when the Hyper provider catalog is unreachable. By default, your
remaining Hypercredit balance is shown in the status line while a Hyper model is
active.

Use `/hyper-status` to configure the status line interactively and toggle things
on/off or reset to the defaults. `teamName` defaults to `false` and
`hypercredits` defaults to `true`. You can also set values directly:

```sh
/hyper-status teamName true
/hyper-status hypercredits false
/hyper-status reset
```
